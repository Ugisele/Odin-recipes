               <li>1 golden delicious apple - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
                
                1 clove garlic, minced</li> 
                
               <li>1/2 cup frozen petite peas</li> 
                
               <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li> 
                
               <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li> 
                
               <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. <br> Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until fork tender, <br> 10-12 minutes; drain.</li>

        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir smoked sausage <br> in skillet until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. <br> Remove sausage from skillet to a paper towel-lined plate; leave drippings in pan.</li>

        <li>Quarter the potatoes. Cook and stir potatoes, red pepper, green pepper, onion, <br> and apple in the skillet until potatoes are starting to brown, <br> 8 to 10 minutes; add oil as needed. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

        <li>Return sausage to the skillet, stir in peas and thyme, and cook until peas are <br> heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; <br> garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
